## 2025-05-20 - Unbounded File Downloads
**Vulnerability:** The `downloadRingCentralAttachment` function defaulted to buffering the entire response into memory (`response.arrayBuffer()`) when the optional `maxBytes` parameter was omitted.
**Learning:** Optional security parameters often lead to insecure defaults. Developers might assume a reasonable system default exists, but in this case, it was unbounded, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.
**Prevention:** Always enforce a safe default limit for resource-intensive operations (like file downloads) inside the utility function itself, rather than relying on the caller to provide a limit.
